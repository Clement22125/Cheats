#### About offsets
I will not be updating memory offsets often, you have to update them by yourself if something is not working.

#### About the cheat
The entire idea of the cheat is educational (believe it or not).
It's a nice way to learn how to manipulate game memory and learn some math concepts in a 3D space (Damn you CalcAngle and Vectors...)
It was developed and tested purely AGAINST BOTS (a couple of times on community servers .. oopsie) and never in competitive games.

#### Detection status
Currently undetected by VAC but since I am releasing it publicly use at your own risk!
